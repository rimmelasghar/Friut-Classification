# Friut Classification with XGBoost

What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library;

Prerequisites
You‚Äôll need to install the following libraries with pip: -> NUMPY -> PANDAS -> SKLEARN -> XGBOOST

You can easily download this libaries using pip by using following command:

pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost

Summary
In this Python project,I have made a model to classify differrent types of Dates(Friut) using various factors. I have used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives an accuracy of 87.2%, which is good enough considering the number of lines of code in this python project.

Dont Forget to follow me so we can be a part of this awesome journey of ML projects. More to deliverüë®‚Äçüíª
